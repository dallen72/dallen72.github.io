<p>A top-down 2D game I was working on using Godot with a few other people.</p>

<p>The repository is privately hosted somewhere else but I contributed most of the source code.</p>

<p>Images of the game is shown in this repo:</p>

<p><img src="Morpheus-2D-game-Lobby.png" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>I designed the menu from the background art that was
given to me and coded a multiplayer lobby which was working in a LAN. We also had some gameplay
mechanics working.</p>
